# Ciora

Ciora is a **Bash-based recon automation tool** built for bug bounty hunters and pentesters.  
It downloads the **HackerOne program scope** (public or private with session cookie), extracts web assets & wildcards, and optionally performs **subdomain enumeration** using multiple tools.

---

## Features
- Supports **public & private HackerOne programs** (cookie auth for private).  
- Automatically extracts:  
  - Web assets  
  - Wildcards  
  - Cleaned wildcard domains  
- Subdomain enumeration with:  
  - Amass  
  - Sublist3r  
  - Assetfinder  
  - Subfinder  
  - ShuffleDNS  
- **Future improvements:** add tools to clean more subdomains, URLs, and perform deeper scope analysis.  
- Merges results into one file (`all_subdomains.txt`).  
- Pretty banner + clean output.

---

## Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ciora.git

example-wildscope.txt         # Wildcards cleaned (no *)

subdomains/                   # Subdomain results per tool
all_subdomains.txt            # Final merged subdomain list
```
